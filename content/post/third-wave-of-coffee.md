**Third Wave Coffee**

The third wave of coffee began in the 1970s and really took off by the end of the 1980s. With the increase in international travel and more awareness about European coffee customs, American coffee shops started to offer an increased variety of espresso drinks, such as the now very common latte, cappuccino, espresso, and all their varieties.

Starbucks started to offer specialty espresso beverages in 1987 and expanded into frappuccinos, ice cream, and increased milk and flavor options. With the increase in Starbucks stores all over the US, this caused smaller coffee shops to become more popular. The [“Starbucks effect”](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2007/12/dont_fear_starbucks.html) was due to the fact that customers flock to a new Starbucks and, in so doing, notice the small, independent coffee shop next door.

American coffee shops over the past thirty years have become places to meet, work, network, and socialize. Coffee consumption has become a higher art form with barista competitions and milk-foaming artwork.

The rise of supporting fair trade coffee suppliers and quality over quantity is also a part of the third wave ethos. It has become important to consumers to know where their products are sourced and if the workers are fairly treated. The taste and quality of the bean have also become an integral to the third wave trend.

Some of what Peet’s and Starbucks started has trickled down into the small, independent coffee shops that thrive in many cities. Those who may have supported Starbucks in its infancy are likely to regard it as too corporate now and may support a local shop that roasts its own beans. Most coffee shops outside of Starbucks still use manual espresso machines while Starbucks switched to automatic machines. Purists would say this is a move towards a less flavourful cup of coffee without individuality.

The rise of the coffee shop and artisanal coffee experience is thriving in most American cities. Quality, sourced beans, fair trade practices, and a welcoming, comfortable shop atmosphere are the main characteristics of the third wave trend.

Many local coffee shops become a sort of community center for artists and musicians, similar to how coffeehouses started in Europe in the 1700’s, where people discussed ideas and politics. However, this time around, women are welcome and no one smokes inside; two vast improvements on the old model!
