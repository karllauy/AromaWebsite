> Gesha Village Coffee Estate on their signature blend - "Chaka"

The Chaka blend is a blend that consists of three gesha species - Gori gesha, gesha1931, and Illubabor. They are all Natural processed under the sun. This coffee bean is having a high quality due to the hand-pick process and the raised drying bed. Overall, it has a rich tasting profile: honey sweetness, juicy acidity, and a rounded, full, and silky mouthfeel. It's a perfect blend for gesha lover yet very affordable.\

When we roast this coffee bean, we perform secondary screening to remove any defected bean. We are using a fast roasting profile, applying large amount of heat in the early stage of the roast, then gentling head towards the degree we'd like it to reach. We'd say it's a city to full-city roast, which the coffee is well developed yet keeping the acidity and fruity favour of it.\
